Now we have to finally complete the buy and sell functionality.
So right now the users available_inr is 100000 and available_btc is 10000000.
If he presses Buy Bitcoin Button, the singleinputmodal of the TradingModal opens.
The user then enters 10000 while he sees the buy rate to be ₹1,00,00,000. Then he presses the Buy Now button.
This opens the ConfirmationModal, showing him ₹10000 as main value and ₿0.001 as the subamount. He checks the details and presses Buy Now.
This creates a record in the transactions Table with the following details.

  user_id 1
  type 'MARKET_BUY'
  status 'EXECUTED'
  
  -- Amount fields
  btc_amount 100000  -- BTC amount in satoshis
  inr_amount 10000    -- INR amount in rupees
  execution_price 10000000   -- Actual execution price (INR per BTC)

then in the users table, available_inr gets reduced by 10000, and available_btc gets increased by 100000.


The following would happen if he had decided to sell ₿0.001 when the sell rate was ₹1,00,00,000.

  user_id 1
  type 'MARKET_SELL'
  status 'EXECUTED'
  
  -- Amount fields
  btc_amount 100000  -- BTC amount in satoshis
  inr_amount 10000    -- INR amount in rupees
  execution_price 10000000   -- Actual execution price (INR per BTC)

then in the users table, available_inr gets increased by 10000, and available_btc gets decreased by 100000.
