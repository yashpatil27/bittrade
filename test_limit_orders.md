# Testing Limit Order Functionality

## Overview
Based on the conversation history, I have implemented the following components for limit order functionality:

1. **Database Schema**: Updated to use `execution_price` for both target and actual prices
2. **Server API**: Added `/api/orders` endpoint to create limit orders
3. **Client API**: Added `createLimitOrder` function in `tradingApi.ts`  
4. **UI Components**: Updated `TradingModal` to handle limit orders

## How to Test

### 1. Database Setup
The `execution_price` column in the transactions table now serves dual purposes:
- For limit orders (status='PENDING'): stores the target price
- For executed orders (status='EXECUTED'): stores the actual execution price

### 2. UI Flow Testing
1. Open the trading modal (Buy or Sell)
2. Click the settings gear icon
3. Select "Limit Order" from the options modal
4. Enter a target price in the target price modal
5. Enter the amount you want to trade
6. Confirm the transaction

### 3. Expected Behavior
- For **limit orders**: Transaction is created with status='PENDING' and execution_price set to target price
- For **market orders**: Transaction is executed immediately with current market rate

### 4. API Endpoints
- `POST /api/orders` - Creates pending limit orders
- `POST /api/trade` - Executes market orders immediately (existing functionality)

### 5. Database Records
Limit orders will appear in the transactions table with:
- `type`: 'LIMIT_BUY' or 'LIMIT_SELL'
- `status`: 'PENDING'
- `execution_price`: The target price set by user
- `btc_amount`: Amount in satoshis
- `inr_amount`: Amount in rupees

### 6. Transaction List Display
The TransactionList component should now show both:
- Pending limit orders (status='PENDING')
- Executed transactions (status='EXECUTED')

Pending orders will be sorted to appear at the top of the list.

## Implementation Summary
- ✅ Server endpoint for creating limit orders
- ✅ Client API function for limit orders  
- ✅ Updated TradingModal UI flow
- ✅ Database schema optimized (single execution_price column)
- ✅ Proper type definitions and error handling

The system is now ready to handle limit orders alongside the existing market order functionality.
